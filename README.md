# electron-test
Going to throw in a lot of ugly code in here for funzies. Plan is to use
this space as a learning space for all things JavaScript. Current work
will revolve around CoffeeScript/TypeScript/JSX with frameworks/libs
jQuery/Angular/React respectively.

# Development
Using `yarn` from Facebook to manage npm modules. Currently using `gulp` for
tooling and building. Switch to `webpack` later when/if project gets big
enough to take advantage of static module builds from `webpack`.

# TODO
* Configure gulpfile to do basic tooling
  - Transpile/Compile (CoffeeScript/TypeScript/JSX)
  - Uglify
  - Minify
  - Concat
